# datacentric.group

datacentric.group is a community dedicated to database-centric architectures.

A significant amount of software development revolves around data, but while topics such as test driven development, microservices, devops and many others are constantly discussed online, data management has fallen out of favor in relation to its importance.

We believe that writing software which manipulates data should be a solved problem, but it still is embarrassingly costly to write and maintain and that whose difficulties cause significant pain.
